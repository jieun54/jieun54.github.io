## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Michigan School of Information. As a computational social scientist, I leverage computational methods and social science theories to extract insights
into online user behaviors and interactions from large-scale data.

## Research Interests

- **Online Prosocial Behaviors:** I study the spread of online prosociality and propose design recommendations for online platforms to promote prosociality based on empirical findings.
- **Online Antisocial Behaviors:** I investigate how antisocial behaviors spread in online environments and explore dark design patterns embedded in online platforms.

## News

- **[May, 2025]** I will attend the CSST 2025 Summer Institute!
