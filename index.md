I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Michigan School of Information, advised by Libby Hemphill. As a computational social scientist, I leverage computational methods and social science theories to extract insights into online user behaviors and interactions from large-scale data. My research topics are as follows:

- **Online Prosocial Behaviors:** I study the spread of online prosociality and propose design recommendations for online platforms to promote prosociality based on empirical findings.
- **Online Antisocial Behaviors:** I investigate how antisocial behaviors spread in online environments and explore dark design patterns embedded in online platforms.
